    ### How are daily transactions counted?    
    To calculate daily transactions on Optimism (as well as other chains transactions), 
    all transactions that interact with on protocols are included. 
    
    The users that have had as the first transactions called as **New Users**.
    All addresses that execute a transaction interacting on Optimisms' ecosystem
    for the first time have been counted as **New Users** number.
    
    ### Popularity assessed by:
    The volume of active users on Optimism per week over past year
    The adoption by new users per week
    
    ### How is the users growth(Cumulative) calculated?    
    On a given week, all addresses that execute a transaction interacting for the first time have been counted 
    towards the weekly New Users number. 
    The cumulative curve is simply a progressive sum of the new weekly users.  
    
    ### Performance assessed by:
    The success rate of transactions in the Optimism
    The average STPM(Succeed Transactions per Minute) per week
    The average FTR(Failed Transactions Rate) per week
    The average blocks size
    The average transactions fee($)
